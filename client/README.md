# SCAMANDER 2 BABY

Scamander Likely, the intrepid space cowboy has evolved into Scamander Likely the Grundle Pirate.

## Action Plan

- [X] Initial folder structure
- [ ] Port over component builder logic
- [ ] Rebuild className builder logic in tandem with SCSS compile logic.
  **of interest:**
  - classNames package. Handles merge logic, de-duping, clean toggle logic with standard outputs
  - import SCSS builder variables to JS builder source of truth
  - based off the previous, it may be sensible to include a classNames builder feature

- [ ] Port over router logic
- [ ] Initial API folder structure
- [ ] Connection to firebase
- [ ]
